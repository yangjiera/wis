Jie Yang is an Assistant Professor at the Web Information Systems group of the Faculty of Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science (EEMCS/EWI), Delft University of Technology. At the WIS group, Jie co-leads the research line on Crowd Computing and Human-Centered AI. In addition, he is co-leading the Delft AI “Design@Scale” Lab and the “Embedded AI” Lab. 

Prior to joining the WIS group, Jie worked as a Machine Learning Scientist at Alexa Shopping, Amazon Research, based in Seattle, and a Senior Researcher at the eXascale Infolab, University of Fribourg - Switzerland. Jie received his Ph.D. from TU Delft in 2017, M.Sc. from TU Eindhoven in 2013, and B.Eng. from Zhejiang University in 2011. During his M.Sc., he also spent some time at Philips Research.

Jie's research focuses on human-centered machine learning for Web-scale information systems, aiming at leveraging the joint power of human and machine intelligence  for understanding and making use of data in large-scale information systems. Over the past few years, he has worked on integrating human computation with model training in active learning, transfer learning, and weakly-supervised learning settings, to allow models to effectively and efficiently learn from small, sparse and noisy data. More recently at TU Delft, his research focuses on human-centered approaches for more interpretable and reliable machine learning systems.
